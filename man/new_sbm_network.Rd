\usage{
new_sbm_network(
  edges = dplyr::tibble(),
  nodes = NULL,
  edges_from_column = from,
  edges_to_column = to,
  bipartite_edges = FALSE,
  setup_model = TRUE,

  default_node_type = "node",
  show_warnings = interactive(),
  random_seed = NULL,
  remove_isolated_nodes = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{Dataframe with a from and two column encoding edges between
string node ids (direction does not matter).}

\item{nodes}{Optional dataframe that links a node \code{id} to its \code{type}, for
when model is polypartite.}

\item{edges_from_column}{Name of the from column for edges}

\item{edges_to_column}{Name of the to column for edges}

\item{bipartite_edges}{Do the passed edges reflect a bipartite struture? I.e.
are nodes in from \code{from} column of a different type to those in the \code{to}
column?}

\item{setup_model}{Should an SBM model object be added? Set to \code{FALSE} if
network is just being visualized or described.}

\item{allowed_edge_types}{A dataframe in the same format of as \code{edges} that contains
allowed pairs (order does not matter) of possible node type combinations
across edges. For instance: nodes of type pollinator are allowed to connect
to flower nodes but not to other pollinator nodes. If this is left
undefined, it is inferred from edges.}

\item{default_node_type}{What should nodes that the type is generated for be
called?}

\item{show_warnings}{Do you want to be warned when minor problems are
detected by function? Useful to disable when not running in an interactive
mode etc.}

\item{random_seed}{Integer seed to be passed to model's internal random
sampling engine. Note that if the model is restored from a saved state this
seed will be initialized again to the start value which will harm
reproducability.}

\item{remove_isolated_nodes}{Should the network filter out nodes that have no
edges? This option should only be set to \code{FALSE} for visualization purposes
as the SBM model needs at least one edge for every node to work.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{sbm_network}. For details see
\code{\link{new_sbm_network}} section "Class structure."
}
\description{
Constructs an object with the \code{sbm_network} class. Takes as input at a
minumum an edge dataframe and will also accept a nodes dataframe that can
contain addition information about the nodes in the network. A helper for
allowing bipartite structure is provided which will treat either side of
passed edges dataframe as two different types of nodes.
}
\section{Class structure}{


The \code{sbm_network} class is an S3 class with two minimum components:

\describe{ \item{\verb{$edges}}{Edges that the network is built out of. This is
simply the passed \code{edges} input to the function.} \item{\verb{$nodes}}{Nodes
that the edges connect. This is either the passed \code{nodes} input or is
created from the \code{edges} input automatically by listing the unique node ids
seen in the edges.} }

If the method \code{\link{mcmc_sweep}} has been run on the \code{sbm_network}
object then a \verb{$sweep_result} slot will be added. For more info see
\code{\link{mcmc_sweep}}.

If either of the methods \code{\link{collapse_blocks}} or
\code{\link{collapse_run}} have been applied to the \code{sbm_network} object
then the slot \verb{$collapse_result} will be append.

A few attributes are contained by the class as well:

\describe{ \item{\code{n_nodes}}{Number of unique nodes in the current model.
Equivalent to \code{nrow(sbm_network$nodes)}.} \item{\code{n_edges}}{Number of edges
in the current model. Equivalent to \code{nrow(sbm_network$edges)}.}
\item{\code{node_types}}{"Vector of the unique types for nodes in network"}
\item{\code{from_column}}{Raw quosure representing the \code{edges_from_column}
argument. This is kept so bipartite network types can be inferred and no
modification of the passed \code{edges} dataframe needs to take place.}
\item{\code{to_column}}{Same as \code{from_column}} \item{\code{model}}{ S4 class that is
exported by the C++ code used to implement all the modeling algorithms.
Most of the time the user should not have to interact with this object and
thus it can be ignored.} }

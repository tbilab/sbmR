\usage{
sim_random_network(
  n_nodes = 5,
  prob_of_edge = 0.7,
  allow_self_edges = FALSE,
  setup_model = FALSE,
  random_seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_nodes}{Total number of unique nodes to simulate}

\item{prob_of_edge}{Probability of any given edges between two nodes
occuring}

\item{allow_self_edges}{Should nodes be allowed to have edges to
themselves?}

\item{setup_model}{Should an SBM model object be added? Set to \code{FALSE} if
network is just being visualized or described.}

\item{random_seed}{Integer seed to be passed to model's internal random
sampling engine. Note that if the model is restored from a saved state this
seed will be initialized again to the start value which will harm
reproducability.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{sbm_network}. For details see
\code{\link{new_sbm_network}} section "Class structure."
}
\description{
Generate an edge dataframe from an \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd\%C5\%91s\%E2\%80\%93R\%C3\%A9nyi_model}{Erdos-Renyi network.} An edge will occur
between two nodes with a uniform common probability.
}
\examples{

# Basic random network
sim_random_network(n_nodes = 10, prob_of_edge = 0.5)

# Simulate a fully connected network by setting probability of edge to 1
sim_random_network(n_nodes = 10, prob_of_edge = 1)

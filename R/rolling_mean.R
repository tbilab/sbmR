#' Calculate a lagged rolling mean
#'
#' Returns a vector of the rolling mean of a vector calculated for a given
#' window size.
#'
#' The rolling mean is calculated using the available data. For elements at
#' start of the vector before a full window is able to fit, the mean is simply
#' taken with respect to the available values. E.g. for a window size of `3` the
#' first element will be the same as the source vector, the second will be the
#' second elements distance from mean of the first and second elements of the
#' source vector, and the remaining will be the mean of the element and the
#' previous two elements.
#'
#' This is used internally to compute elbow points in entropy calculations

#' @return Vector of same length as `vec` with each element being the mean of

#' Simulate network using stochastic block model
#'
#' Simulates nodes and edges from a network where edge edges are derived
#' from the Stochastic Block Model. A dataframe describing the different blocks
#' present and the number of nodes within them, a dataframe that provides the
#' `propensity` of edge between two edges, and a distribution function
#' who's main parameter the `propensity` value defines are needed.

#' @inheritParams new_sbm_network
#' @param block_info A dataframe/tibble with two columns: `block`: the id of the
#'   block, and `n_nodes`: the number of nodes to simulate from that block.
#' @param edge_propensities A dataframe with 3 columns: `block_1`: the id
#'   of the from block, `block_2`: the id of the to block, and `propensity`: the
#'   parameter for `edge_dist` that controls if and or how many edges should
#'   occur between the pair of blocks on average.
#' @param edge_dist A distribution function that has two inputs: the first is
#'   number of samples to draw and the second the `propensity` value from
#'   `edge_propensities`. For instance, the default value is `rpois` which
#'   takes two arguments: `n` and `lambda`. In this scenario the `propensity` of
#'   edges between two nodes is provided to `lambda` and thus is the
#'   average number of edges for each pair of nodes between two given
#'   blocks.
#' @param allow_self_edges Should nodes be allowed to have edges to
#'   themselves?
#' @param keep_edge_counts Should the edge counts stay on returned
#'   edges? If edges distribution is a binary yes or no then you will likely
#'   want to set this to `TRUE`.
